## LSCI 253M Exercise

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("example_data_for_visualization.csv")
head(df)
```

## Plots

```{r}
# reorder labels to form pairs
df$label <- factor(df$label, levels = c("P", "B", "T", "D","K","G"))
# plot
ggplot(df,aes(x=label,y=cog,fill=label)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE) +
  theme_classic()
```

The plot above shows the distribution of Center of Gravity (CoG) for voiceless/voiced pairs of word-initial stops. We observe that voiceless stops (/p/,/t/,and /k/) have longer CoGs than their voiced counterparts (/b/,/d/, and /g/).

```{r}
# reorder labels to form pairs
df$pos <- factor(df$pos, levels = c("utt_init", "utt_mid", "prepause", "postpause","utt_final"))
ggplot(df,aes(x=vdur,fill=vowel)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlim(0,500)
```

The above plot shows the distribution of vowel durations

```{r}
df$pos <- factor(df$pos, levels = c("utt_init", "utt_mid", "prepause", "postpause","utt_final"))
ggplot(df,aes(x=trial,y=usef0,color=gender)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_classic()

```

The above plot shows the fundamental frequency (f0) across trials by gender. While there appears
to be no difference in how f0 trends across trials, we observe that, on average, female participants
had higher f0s.
